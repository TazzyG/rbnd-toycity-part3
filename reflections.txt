How long did you spend working on this project?
	Started Lessons: May 20th, excited to use objects, methods, and apply lessons

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
What two additional features did you build? Why?
Where do you still have room to grow?

Notes: 
Initial challenge: Find away to prevent duplicate products
Approach: Started with identifying classes and some of the methods I needed to work on. (a skeleton so to speak) and made sure I could run commented code in my console.
