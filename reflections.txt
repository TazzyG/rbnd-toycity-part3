How long did you spend working on this project?
	Started Lessons: May 20th, excited to use objects, methods, and apply lessons
	It is now May 23. I spent between 2 and 4 hours a day. So, with breaking things, churning a bit, total time is 12 hours. 

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

	Top: Learning about self methods. (finding things with arrays)

	Others: 
	Getting more comfortable with classes, an ahaha was to add methods to use in one class and call it in another. 

	Getting better at using looping through arrays to find and do things. 
	Using a self.find before it could for example match product to transaction 

	App.rb is like a series of TDD tests, RSpec is on my list to learn more. This is a nice precursor. I liked following along an uncommenting when it worked. Also, rewarding as it showed progress through required functions. 

	Using irb and iterating through different pieces of code. Much friendlier and learned a ton. 

	Git hub - can't enough into saving regularly 

What two additional features did you build? Why?
	1) Customer's favorite Brands, so we know who to please and get it for them. 
	2) Seasonal promotions, time sensitive pricing. Because that's how things really work. 

Where do you still have room to grow?

	Arrays and hashes, I know I will need to get solid with mapping, creating new arrays and traversing
	Classes, using super, I think that is coming
	Doing things within arrays. For example transaction.customer doesn't just happen. 
	Instance versus class, will take time. 
	Taking my brain from the lessons to creating code on my own. That daunting first blank file.

Notes (these are rambling, you don't have to read on) :-) 
Initial challenge: Find away to prevent duplicate products (got be stumped at first, where to begin)
Approach: 
	Day 1 (4 hours)
	Started by identifying classes and some of the methods I needed to work on. (a skeleton so to speak) and made sure I could run commented code in my console. 
  Plan, build some methods based on our awesome knowledge, nothing like learning from my own code.

  CHURN = (finally figured out product.title, needs loop).. did alot of searching on array methods with unsuccessful results, tried in console, saw that product = Product.new, I was able to see title but not Product.all (first hint that I was dealing with with an array of product items, not hashes) 
  CHURN = Using self in the methods. NoMethodError: undefined method `find_by_title' for Product:Class 
  Small Churn, needed to add attr_reader and options to find stock and price. 

  Helpfull Techniques: Using the Console, and copying and pasting app.rb lines, Found some answers on StackOverflow, and Udacity forum. 

  Day 2 (4 + hours)

  Returning an Error (duplicate product): I am able to make this work in IRB but when I run app.rb it breaks?! Not sure if that is supposed to happen. 

  CHURN = (Getting used to Self versus product) In the case of in stock, versus self.instock. methods for in_stock. I tried to do it as one method, could not make it work. Because @product.stock did not work. This is still a learning area for me. 

  CHURN - Error in console undefined method `in_stock?' for nil:NilClass. 
  Wrong map from this @@products.map{|product|product.stock} to @@products.map do|product| .. as I want it to iterate and do something? Note: Still learning the map and iterations. 
  Still had the same error... It turned out, I was adding using @product instead of product for my iterations.. It works now. 

 	Hmm... puts nanoblock.in_stock? # Should return true but it returned false.
 	In method in_stock? I put a ? after the statement, got syntax error, added true : false, reran it.

 	Having a couple of issues with product methods. 
 	puts products_in_stock.include?(nanoblock) 
 	will try tomorrow 
 	I posted to the forum to see if I could get some help. Return tomorrow.

 	Day 3 (2 hours)
 	Happier day. The answer in the forum pointed me to errors in my methods. Spent some time cleaning up the self.methods. 
 	puts products_in_stock.include?(nanoblock) # Should return true (was returning false)
 	puts transaction2.product == nanoblock # Should return true (was returning false)

 	played in the irb by pasting code from the file. Then followed back through my methods. For example, puts transaction2.product listed the whole transaction. Eventually got it. 

 	Going to have some fun with options. Time for git push.
