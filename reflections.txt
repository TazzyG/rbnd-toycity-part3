How long did you spend working on this project?
	Easily 20 hours, I broke my code lots and experimented. I'm at iterating as I learn. Sometimes, I am breaking things on Purpose. I am using irb on the console. If it weren't for that and git, I'd be insane. 


What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

	Traversing through different classes and calling on a self class, use of loops. 
	(example, Purchasing or Find Transactions by Customer)

What two additional features did you build? Why?

	1) Customer's transaction, so when you talk to a customer you have the whole picture.
	2) TBA
Where do you still have room to grow?

	Arrays and hashes, I know I will need to get solid with mapping, creating new arrays and traversing
	Classes, using super, I think that is coming 
	Instance versus class, will take time. 
	Taking my brain from the lessons to creating code on my own. That daunting first blank file.
	Got stuck a few times with when to use ? at the end of a boolean
