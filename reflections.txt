How long did you spend working on this project?
	Easily 25 hours, I broke my code lots and experimented. I'm at iterating as I learn. Sometimes, I am breaking things on Purpose. I am using irb on the console. If it weren't for that and git, I'd be insane. 


What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

	Bouncing through different classes and calling on methods. 
	(example, Purchasing, Returning things or Find Transactions by Customer)
	Debugging with the console, never used the console as much before :)
	Reminded of reserved words when I tried to add "ref" to my transactions.

What two additional features did you build? Why?

	1) Customer's transaction, so when you talk to a customer you have the whole picture.
	2) Returns, because things can happen and you need to reverse it. 

Where do you still have room to grow?

	Arrays and hashes, I know I will need to get solid with mapping, creating new arrays and traversing
	Classes, using super, I think that is coming 
	Instance versus class, will take time but I learned a ton on that this week, that I did not get before.  
	Taking my brain from the lessons to creating code on my own. That daunting first blank file.
	Got stuck a few times with when to use ? at the end of a boolean
	Mostly just practice. I am working on some projects in Rails while doing this. Getting better at Ruby is helping me tons. I didn't know what I didn't know.

	The app.js was awesome this time because I used it as a TDD (list of things that worked) along the way. It also was a motivator as it showed progress. I use Git branch and merge a couple of times when I was intentionally breaking my code.
